# Task Instruction: Model Evaluation for AI Predictor

## Objective
Test the baseline churn prediction model on holdout data and ensure it meets the target accuracy (â‰¥85%).

## Steps
1. Split data into training and holdout sets (if not already done).
2. Evaluate model on holdout set.
3. Analyze performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC).
4. Document results and compare to target.
5. Identify areas for improvement if target not met.

## Minimal Context/Dependencies
- Baseline model (from Task 03)
- Holdout data

## Expected Output
- Evaluation report with metrics
- Recommendations for improvement (if needed)
