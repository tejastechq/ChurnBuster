# Dashboard App Strategy - Phase 2

**Date**: 2025-05-14

**Objective**: To complete the development of the ChurnBuster Dashboard App by implementing backend/API integration, user management, and preparing the app for production deployment.

## 1. Backend/API Integration
### Overview
- **Goal**: Fully integrate API endpoints for Metrics, Playbooks, Alerts, and Authentication to enable dynamic data interaction across all views.
- **Approach**:
  - Develop a backend server (using Flask or Node.js) to handle API requests and serve data for the Dashboard App.
  - Implement endpoints as defined in `dashboard_app_task_04_api_integration.md`.
  - Ensure error handling and data validation on both client and server sides.
  - Test API integration with mock data initially, then connect to real data sources (e.g., AI Predictor, CRM Connector).

### Tasks
- Set up backend environment and project structure.
- Implement API endpoints for Metrics (e.g., customer metrics, churn risk data).
- Implement API endpoints for Playbooks (CRUD operations).
- Implement API endpoints for Alerts (action handling, status updates).
- Integrate Authentication endpoints with backend user database.
- Update `DataContext.tsx` to fetch data from the backend instead of mock data.

## 2. User Management
### Overview
- **Goal**: Implement features for user signup, login, password reset, and profile management to support secure access to the Dashboard App.
- **Approach**:
  - Develop backend logic for user authentication and authorization (using JWT or similar).
  - Create frontend forms for signup, login, and password reset in `Settings.tsx` or a dedicated user management page.
  - Implement secure storage of user credentials and session management.
  - Add route protection to redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

### Tasks
- Design database schema for user data (e.g., username, email, password hash).
- Implement backend endpoints for user signup, login, logout, and password reset.
- Create frontend forms and validation for user management features.
- Update `AuthContext.tsx` to handle user state and authentication tokens.
- Test user management flows for security and usability.

## 3. Productionization
### Overview
- **Goal**: Prepare the Dashboard App for production deployment with proper environment configuration, performance optimization, and security measures.
- **Approach**:
  - Set up environment variables for development, staging, and production.
  - Optimize build process for faster load times (e.g., code splitting, lazy loading).
  - Implement security headers and HTTPS enforcement.
  - Deploy the app to a hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) with CI/CD pipelines.
  - Monitor app performance and errors using tools like Sentry.

### Tasks
- Configure environment variables in `.env` files and build scripts.
- Optimize React components for performance (e.g., memoization, lazy loading).
- Set up security configurations in backend and frontend.
- Deploy backend and frontend to production servers.
- Implement monitoring and logging for production environment.

## 4. Testing and Validation
- **Goal**: Ensure the app is fully functional and bug-free before release.
- **Approach**:
  - Write unit tests for backend endpoints and frontend components.
  - Conduct integration testing for API-client interactions.
  - Perform user acceptance testing with demo accounts.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop test suites for critical features (e.g., authentication, data fetching).
  - Fix any identified bugs or performance issues.

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Backend setup and initial API endpoint implementation for Metrics and Authentication.
- **Week 2**: Complete API integration for Playbooks and Alerts; start user management backend.
- **Week 3**: Finish user management frontend and backend; begin productionization tasks.
- **Week 4**: Complete productionization, testing, and prepare for deployment.

## Dependencies
- Relies on existing UI components and API client setup in `client.ts`.
- Requires integration with other ChurnBuster modules (AI Predictor, CRM Connector) for real data.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Backend development delays due to complexity of data integration.
  - **Mitigation**: Use mock data initially to test frontend integration, then switch to real data.
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in user management.
  - **Mitigation**: Follow best practices for authentication (e.g., JWT, bcrypt for passwords) and conduct security audits.

**Next Steps**: Review this strategy, adjust based on feedback, and move to Execution phase to start backend development.
