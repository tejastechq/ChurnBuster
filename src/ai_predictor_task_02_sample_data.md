# Task Instruction: Ingest Sample Data for AI Predictor

## Objective
Obtain and preprocess sample CRM data (Salesforce/HubSpot export or synthetic) for model development and testing.

## Steps
1. Acquire sample CRM data export (CSV/JSON) or generate synthetic data matching schema.
2. Validate data against defined schema.
3. Preprocess data (cleaning, normalization, feature engineering).
4. Store processed data for model training and evaluation.

## Minimal Context/Dependencies
- Data schema (from Task 01)
- CRM Connector (for real data, if available)

## Expected Output
- Preprocessed sample dataset ready for model development
- Data validation report
