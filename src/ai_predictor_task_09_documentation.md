# Task Instruction: Document & Handoff for AI Predictor

## Objective
Write comprehensive documentation for the AI Predictor model, including retraining guide and known limitations, to support handoff and future maintenance.

## Steps
1. Document model architecture, training process, and evaluation results.
2. Write a retraining guide (data requirements, scripts, process).
3. List known limitations and assumptions.
4. Organize documentation for easy handoff to engineering/ML teams.

## Minimal Context/Dependencies
- All previous tasks (model, data, integrations)

## Expected Output
- Complete documentation for AI Predictor module
- Retraining guide
- List of limitations/assumptions
