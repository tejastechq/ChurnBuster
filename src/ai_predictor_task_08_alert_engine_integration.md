# Task Instruction: Integrate with Alert Engine

## Objective
Trigger notifications for high-risk customers by integrating the AI Predictor with the Alert Engine.

## Steps
1. Define alert criteria and data contract (fields, format).
2. Implement notification trigger logic in AI Predictor.
3. Integrate with Alert Engine API or messaging system.
4. Test alerting with simulated high-risk predictions.
5. Document integration and alerting logic.

## Minimal Context/Dependencies
- Alert Engine (API/data contract)
- Prediction API (from Task 05)

## Expected Output
- Working alert integration between AI Predictor and Alert Engine
- Documentation for alerting logic
