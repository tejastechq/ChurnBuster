# Task Instruction: Develop Baseline Churn Prediction Model

## Objective
Implement a simple churn prediction model (TensorFlow, Python) and evaluate its accuracy on the sample dataset.

## Steps
1. Load preprocessed sample data.
2. Select baseline model architecture (e.g., logistic regression, simple neural net).
3. Implement model in TensorFlow (Python).
4. Train model and monitor metrics (accuracy, loss).
5. Evaluate model on holdout data, target â‰¥85% accuracy.
6. Document model code and results.

## Minimal Context/Dependencies
- Preprocessed sample data (from Task 02)
- Data schema

## Expected Output
- Baseline model code (TensorFlow, Python)
- Training/evaluation results
- Documentation of model and findings
