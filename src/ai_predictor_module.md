# AI Predictor Module (Domain Module)

## Purpose
Develop and maintain the core machine learning model(s) for churn and upsell prediction, forming the intelligence backbone of ChurnBuster. This module is responsible for ingesting CRM data, training and serving models, and providing prediction APIs to other system components.

## Scope
- Churn prediction (MVP)
- Upsell prediction (Phase 2)
- Model training, evaluation, and serving
- Data ingestion interface (from CRM Connector)
- API for predictions (to Dashboard, Alert Engine)

## Interfaces
- **Input:** Customer data from CRM Connector (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- **Output:** Churn/upsell risk scores to Dashboard App, Alert Engine, Report Generator

## High-Level Implementation Plan
- Define data schema and ingestion pipeline
- Develop baseline churn prediction model (TensorFlow, Python)
- Implement model training and evaluation scripts
- Expose prediction API (REST or gRPC)
- Integrate with CRM Connector for data
- Integrate with Dashboard App for metrics
- Integrate with Alert Engine for notifications
- Document model assumptions, limitations, and retraining procedures

## Dependencies
- CRM Connector (for data)
- Dashboard App (for output)
- Alert Engine (for output)
- Report Generator (for output)
