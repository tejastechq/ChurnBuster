# Active Context

**Current State**: The Dashboard App for ChurnBuster has completed core UI implementation for all views (Overview, Metrics, Playbooks, Alerts, Settings) with static layouts and navigation. Partial API integration is done (endpoints defined, data mapping, state management, API client setup, Overview data integrated). However, integration for Metrics, Playbooks, Alerts, Authentication, and Testing/Debugging are pending. The app is not yet production-ready: full backend/API integration, user management, and productionization are still needed. Other modules (AI Predictor, CRM Connector, Alert Engine, Report Generator) are implemented, tested, and documented.

**Recent Decisions**: Completed Consolidation phase for the current cycle. Verified and consolidated all key learnings and outcomes from the previous execution cycle. Reorganized `changelog.md` for better readability.

**Priorities**: The next steps are:
- Complete backend/API integration for the Dashboard App (Metrics, Playbooks, Alerts, Authentication)
- User management (signup, password reset, profile management)
- Productionization (deployment, environment config, etc.)

## Current Work Focus:
- Dashboard App: Prepare for completing backend/API integration, user management, and productionization.
- All other modules are up to date as of May 14, 2025.
- See `consolidation_notes.md` for key learnings and outcomes from other modules.

## Current Progress
- **Dashboard App**: Core UI implementation complete for all views. Partial API integration done; full backend/API integration, user management, and productionization are next.
- **Next Steps**: Plan and execute completion of backend/API integration, user management, and productionization for the Dashboard App.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Dashboard App backend/API integration, user management, and productionization are the current focus for implementation.
- All other modules are up to date as of May 14, 2025.
- See `consolidation_notes.md` for key learnings and outcomes from other modules.
- Completed verification and extraction for batch 1 containing files [dashboard_app_task_03_core_ui.md, dashboard_app_task_04_api_integration.md, dashboard_app_implementation_plan.md]. Information recorded in `consolidation_notes.md`.
- Completed cleanup workflow by archiving completed task file `dashboard_app_task_03_core_ui.md` to `cline_docs/archive/tasks/` and obsolete consolidation notes `consolidation_notes.md` to `cline_docs/archive/session_trackers/`.
- Verified dependencies for key `1Ba2` (dashboard_app_implementation_plan.md) in `dashboard_app_module.md`. Updated placeholders to appropriate dependency types ('n' for .gitignore, '<' for task files, configuration files, and code directories).
- Verified dependencies for key `1Ba3` (dashboard_app_task_04_api_integration.md) in `dashboard_app_module.md`. Updated placeholders to appropriate dependency types ('n' for unrelated files, '<' for configuration files, '>' for source code).
- Verified dependencies for key `1Ba4` (package-lock.json) in `dashboard_app_module.md`. Updated placeholders to appropriate dependency types ('n' for unrelated files, 'x' for package.json, '>' for configuration files and code directories).
- Verified dependencies for key `1Ba5` (package.json) in `dashboard_app_module.md`. Updated placeholders to appropriate dependency types ('n' for unrelated files, '>' for configuration files and code directories).
- Verified dependencies for key `1Ba6` (postcss.config.js) in `dashboard_app_module.md`. Updated placeholders to appropriate dependency types ('n' for unrelated files, 'x' for tailwind.config.js, '>' for source code).
- Verified dependencies for key `1Ba7` (tailwind.config.js) in `dashboard_app_module.md`. Updated placeholders to appropriate dependency types ('n' for unrelated files, 'x' for postcss.config.js, '>' for source code).
- Verified dependencies for key `1Ba8` (tsconfig.json) in `dashboard_app_module.md`. Updated placeholders to appropriate dependency types ('n' for unrelated files, '>' for source code).
- Verified dependencies for key `2A` (public) in `dashboard_app_module.md`. Updated placeholders to appropriate dependency types ('n' for unrelated files, '<' for source code).
- Verified dependencies for key `2B` (src) in `dashboard_app_module.md`. Updated placeholders to appropriate dependency types ('n' for unrelated files).
- Completed Set-up/Maintenance phase by verifying dependencies for all keys in `dashboard_app_module.md`. Prepared dependency trackers and diagrams for the project.
- Next focus: Strategy phase to plan backend/API integration, user management, and productionization for the Dashboard App.
