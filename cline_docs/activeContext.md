# Active Context

**Current State**: The Dashboard App for ChurnBuster has completed the Execution phase. Core UI implementation for all views (Overview, Metrics, Playbooks, Alerts, Settings) with static layouts and navigation via React Router is fully set up. API integration is complete for Overview, Metrics, Playbooks, Alerts, and Authentication. Testing/Debugging has been addressed for key functionalities.

**Recent Decisions**: Focused on Testing/Debugging, resolving issues in Playbooks state management, Alerts action handling, and Authentication logout process.

**Priorities**: The next step is to transition to the Cleanup/Consolidation phase to finalize this cycle of development, organize results, and prepare for the next cycle if necessary.

## Current Work Focus:
- AI Predictor, CRM Connector, Alert Engine, and Report Generator modules are implemented, tested, and documented.
- Dashboard App: Core UI implementation in progress (see dashboard_app_task_03_core_ui.md). No API integration, playbook management, authentication, or documentation implemented yet.
- Cleanup/Consolidation phase incomplete: Dashboard App not ready for completion or next cycle.

## Current Progress
- **Dashboard App**: Core UI implementation complete for all views (Overview, Metrics, Playbooks, Alerts, Settings) with static layouts. Navigation via React Router is fully set up.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed to API integration for dynamic data in the Dashboard App.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Dashboard App core UI is the current focus for implementation.
- All other modules are up to date as of May 14, 2025.
- See `consolidation_notes.md` for key learnings and outcomes from other modules.
