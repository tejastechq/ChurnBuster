Instructions: Fill in the placeholders below to create the Roadmap Summary.
This document summarizes the unified plan for the current development cycle,
consolidating information from individual Implementation Plans and providing
a high-level execution overview. It is the final output of the Strategy Phase for the cycle's goals.

## Unified Execution Sequence / Flow (High-Level)
<!--
Provide a high-level overview of the combined execution sequence across all planned areas.
This could be a numbered list, phases, or a Mermaid diagram showing major steps/task groups and their dependencies.
Focus on `Execution_*` tasks. Highlight key milestones, integration points, or critical paths.
Reference parent Implementation Plans for task details.
-->

**Example (Numbered List):**

1.  **Setup & Foundational (Plan: `{planA.md}`)**:
    *   Task `E_TaskA1`
    *   Task `E_TaskA2`
2.  **Core Logic - Area 1 (Plan: `{planB.md}`)**:
    *   Task `E_TaskB1` (Requires: `E_TaskA2`)
    *   Task `E_TaskB2`
3.  **Core Logic - Area 2 (Plan: `{planC.md}`)**:
    *   Task `E_TaskC1` (Requires: `E_TaskA2`)
4.  **Integration Point 1 (Plans: `{planB.md}`, `{planC.md}`)**:
    *   Task `E_TaskB3` (Requires: `E_TaskB2`, `E_TaskC1`) - *Critical Path*
5.  **UI Implementation (Plan: `{planD.md}`)**:
    *   Task `E_TaskD1` (Requires: `E_TaskB3`)
    *   ...
6.  **Final Documentation Updates (Plan: `{planE.md}`)**:
    *   Task `E_TaskE1`

**Example (Mermaid):**
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Phase 1: Foundations (Plan A)"
        A_T1[E_TaskA1] --> A_T2[E_TaskA2];
    end
    subgraph "Phase 2: Core Area 1 (Plan B)"
        B_T1[E_TaskB1] --> B_T2[E_TaskB2];
    end
    subgraph "Phase 3: Core Area 2 (Plan C)"
        C_T1[E_TaskC1];
    end
    subgraph "Phase 4: Integration (Plans B, C)"
        B_T3[E_TaskB3 - Critical];
    end
    subgraph "Phase 5: UI (Plan D)"
        D_T1[E_TaskD1];
    end
     subgraph "Phase 6: Docs (Plan E)"
        E_T1[E_TaskE1];
    end

    A_T2 --> B_T1;
    A_T2 --> C_T1;
    B_T2 --> B_T3;
    C_T1 --> B_T3;
    B_T3 --> D_T1;
    D_T1 --> E_T1; %% Example - adjust actual flow
```

## Key Milestones / Integration Points
<!-- Call out specific tasks or phases that represent important milestones or integration points between different areas. -->
*   **Milestone 1:** Completion of Foundational Tasks (Task `E_TaskA2`).
*   **Integration 1:** Merging Area 1 & 2 outputs (Task `E_TaskB3`).
*   **Milestone 2:** UI Complete (Task `E_TaskD1`).

## Notes / Considerations for Execution
<!-- Any final notes, critical path warnings, or important context for the Execution phase based on the unified plan. -->
*   {Note 1: e.g., Pay close attention to the interface defined in Task X during integration.}
*   {Note 2: e.g., Critical path runs through tasks A2 -> C1 -> B3 -> D1.}
