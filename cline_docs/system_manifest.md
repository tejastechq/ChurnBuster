# System Manifest


## Project: ChurnBuster

### Core Objective
Build and monetize a SaaS platform for mid-market SaaS companies to predict churn, identify upsell opportunities, and automate retention strategies using AI-driven insights integrated with CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot).

### Main Domain Modules (Planning Areas)
1. **AI Predictor**: ML model (Python, TensorFlow) for churn and upsell predictions
2. **CRM Connector**: API layer for Salesforce/HubSpot data ingestion (Node.js)
3. **Alert Engine**: Triggers Slack/email notifications based on AI outputs
4. **Dashboard App**: React + Tailwind UI for real-time metrics and playbooks
5. **Report Generator**: CRCT agent for PDF ROI reports using LaTeX

These modules have been delivered for MVP, with all dependencies, integrations, and documentation verified as complete in the Cleanup/Consolidation phase (May 14, 2025). See `consolidation_notes.md` for key learnings and outcomes.
